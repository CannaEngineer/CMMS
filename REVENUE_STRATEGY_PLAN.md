export const checkFeatureAccess = (feature: string) => {
  return async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const organization = req.user.organizationId;
    const hasAccess = await subscriptionService.hasFeatureAccess(organization, feature);
    
    if (!hasAccess) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        error: 'Feature not available in current plan',
        upgradeUrl: `/upgrade?feature=${feature}`
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

#### **Usage Limit Enforcement:**
```typescript
// backend/src/services/usage.service.ts
export class UsageService {
  static async checkUsageLimit(
    organizationId: number, 
    resource: string, 
    limit: number
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    const currentUsage = await this.getCurrentUsage(organizationId, resource);
    return currentUsage < limit;
  }
  
  static async incrementUsage(organizationId: number, resource: string): Promise<void> {
    // Update usage counters
    // Trigger upgrade prompts if approaching limits
  }
}
```

### Billing Integration (Stripe)

#### **Subscription Lifecycle Management:**
```typescript
// backend/src/services/billing.service.ts

      email: organization.billingEmail,
      name: organization.name,
      metadata: { organizationId: organization.id }
    });
    return customer.id;
  }
  
  async createSubscription(customerId: string, priceId: string): Promise<Subscription> {
    return await stripe.subscriptions.create({
      customer: customerId,
      items: [{ price: priceId }],
      payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete',
      expand: ['latest_invoice.payment_intent'],
    });
  }
}
```

### Analytics & Tracking Infrastructure

#### **Event Tracking System:**
```typescript
// backend/src/services/analytics.service.ts
export class AnalyticsService {
  static async trackEvent(
    userId: number,
    organizationId: number,
    event: string,
    properties: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Track user behavior for conversion optimization
    // Monitor feature usage patterns
    // Identify upgrade trigger points
  }
  
  static async getConversionMetrics(organizationId: number): Promise<ConversionMetrics> {
