  description: 'I. Safety Precautions\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Wear safety goggles, gloves, and protective clothing.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Use a face shield if necessary.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Work Area Safety:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Ensure the forklift is turned off and the key is removed.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Keep sparks, flames, and smoking materials away from the battery area.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Battery Safety:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Be cautious of acid spills and leaks.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Avoid short-circuiting the battery terminals.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'II. Tools and Materials Needed\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Distilled water (never use tap water)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Hydrometer (optional, for checking electrolyte levels)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Funnel (preferably with a narrow spout)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Clean cloth or paper towels\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Baking soda (for cleaning up acid spills)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Wrench or pliers (if battery caps are tight)\n' +
    '\n' +
    'III. Steps to Check and Refill Distilled Water\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Access the Battery Compartment:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Locate the battery compartment on the forklift.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Open the battery compartment cover or door as per the forklift’s design.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Inspect the Battery:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Check for any visible damage, leaks, or corrosion on the battery casing.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        If corrosion is present, clean the terminals with a mixture of baking soda and water, then rinse with clean water and dry.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Open the Battery Cell Caps:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Carefully remove the caps from the battery cells. Some batteries may have a single cover with multiple caps, while others may have individual caps.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Use a wrench or pliers if the caps are tight, but be gentle to avoid damaging them.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Check the Electrolyte Levels:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Look inside each cell to check the level of the electrolyte (the liquid covering the battery plates).\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        The electrolyte should cover the plates by about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6-12 mm). If the plates are exposed, the battery needs water.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Refill with Distilled Water:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Using a funnel, slowly add distilled water to each cell until the electrolyte level is just above the plates.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Do not overfill, as the electrolyte can expand during charging and overflow.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        If you accidentally overfill, use a clean syringe or turkey baster to remove excess water.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Close the Battery Cell Caps:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Securely replace the caps on each cell, ensuring they are tight but not over-tightened.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Wipe away any spilled water or electrolyte with a clean cloth.\n' +
    '\n' +

    '\n' +
    '    Distilled water (never use tap water)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Hydrometer (optional, for checking electrolyte levels)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Funnel (preferably with a narrow spout)\n' +

    '    Access the Battery Compartment:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Locate the battery compartment on the forklift.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Open the battery compartment cover or door as per the forklift’s design.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Inspect the Battery:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Check for any visible damage, leaks, or corrosion on the battery casing.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        If corrosion is present, clean the terminals with a mixture of baking soda and water, then rinse with clean water and dry.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Open the Battery Cell Caps:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Carefully remove the caps from the battery cells. Some batteries may have a single cover with multiple caps, while others may have individual caps.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Use a wrench or pliers if the caps are tight, but be gentle to avoid damaging them.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Check the Electrolyte Levels:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Look inside each cell to check the level of the electrolyte (the liquid covering the battery plates).\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        The electrolyte should cover the plates by about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6-12 mm). If the plates are exposed, the battery needs water.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Refill with Distilled Water:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Using a funnel, slowly add distilled water to each cell until the electrolyte level is just above the plates.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Do not overfill, as the electrolyte can expand during charging and overflow.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        If you accidentally overfill, use a clean syringe or turkey baster to remove excess water.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '    Close the Battery Cell Caps:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '        Securely replace the caps on each cell, ensuring they are tight but not over-tightened.\n' +
