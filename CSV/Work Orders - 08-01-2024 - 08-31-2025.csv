91,Inspect Batteries and Refill,DONE,MEDIUM,PREVENTIVE,"I. Safety Precautions

    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):

        Wear safety goggles, gloves, and protective clothing.

        Use a face shield if necessary.

    Work Area Safety:

        Ensure the forklift is turned off and the key is removed.

        Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.

        Keep sparks, flames, and smoking materials away from the battery area.

    Battery Safety:

        Be cautious of acid spills and leaks.

        Avoid short-circuiting the battery terminals.

II. Tools and Materials Needed

    Distilled water (never use tap water)

    Hydrometer (optional, for checking electrolyte levels)

    Funnel (preferably with a narrow spout)

    Clean cloth or paper towels

    Baking soda (for cleaning up acid spills)

    Wrench or pliers (if battery caps are tight)

III. Steps to Check and Refill Distilled Water

    Access the Battery Compartment:

        Locate the battery compartment on the forklift.

        Open the battery compartment cover or door as per the forklift’s design.

    Inspect the Battery:

        Check for any visible damage, leaks, or corrosion on the battery casing.

        If corrosion is present, clean the terminals with a mixture of baking soda and water, then rinse with clean water and dry.

    Open the Battery Cell Caps:

        Carefully remove the caps from the battery cells. Some batteries may have a single cover with multiple caps, while others may have individual caps.

        Use a wrench or pliers if the caps are tight, but be gentle to avoid damaging them.

    Check the Electrolyte Levels:

        Look inside each cell to check the level of the electrolyte (the liquid covering the battery plates).

        The electrolyte should cover the plates by about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6-12 mm). If the plates are exposed, the battery needs water.

    Refill with Distilled Water:

        Using a funnel, slowly add distilled water to each cell until the electrolyte level is just above the plates.

        Do not overfill, as the electrolyte can expand during charging and overflow.

        If you accidentally overfill, use a clean syringe or turkey baster to remove excess water.

    Close the Battery Cell Caps:

        Securely replace the caps on each cell, ensuring they are tight but not over-tightened.

        Wipe away any spilled water or electrolyte with a clean cloth.

    Clean the Battery and Compartment:

        Wipe down the battery casing and surrounding area to remove any dirt or residue.

        Ensure the battery compartment is clean and dry before closing it.

    Close the Battery Compartment:

        Securely close the battery compartment cover or door.

IV. Post-Refill Checks

    Inspect for Leaks:

        After refilling, check for any leaks around the battery caps or casing.

    Charge the Battery:

        If the battery was low on water, it may need to be charged. Follow the forklift’s manual for proper charging procedures.

    Monitor Battery Performance:

        Keep an eye on the battery’s performance and water levels over the next few days to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

V. Maintenance Tips

    Regular Checks: Check the water levels in the battery regularly, especially if the forklift is used frequently.

    Avoid Overcharging: Overcharging can cause the battery to lose water more quickly. Ensure the charging system is functioning correctly.

    Keep Records: Maintain a log of when you check and refill the battery to track its maintenance history.

VI. Troubleshooting

    Low Electrolyte Levels: If the battery consistently requires frequent refilling, it may indicate overcharging or a faulty battery.

    Corrosion: If corrosion is a recurring issue, consider applying a corrosion-resistant spray or gel to the terminals.

    Battery Not Holding Charge: If the battery is not holding a charge despite proper maintenance, it may need to be replaced.",https://app.getmaintainx.com/workorders/52296040?organizationId=342508,52296040,Daniel Crawford,Facilities,,,Daniel Crawford,2025-03-19 10:25:52,2025-05-01 00:00:00,2025-06-01,1:00:00,2025-07-29 10:49:01,2025-07-29 10:49:01,Daniel Crawford,2025-07-29 10:49:01,Yearly|1,General,2648754,Crown Electric Forklift,9559850,"Inspection,Mechanical",,,,,0,0,0,,2146:49:02,2146:49:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,$0.00,$0.00,0,$0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
