## 🎨 Frontend Dashboard Fix

### Issue Fixed: "Tabs is not defined" Error

**Problem**: Dashboard component was using Material-UI `Tabs` and `Tab` components without proper imports and state management.

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ Added missing imports: `Tabs`, `Tab` from `@mui/material`
2. ✅ Added missing state: `useState` import and `selectedTab` state
3. ✅ Added missing handler: `handleTabChange` function
4. ✅ Created missing chart components:
   - `WorkOrdersByStatusChart` - Pie chart for work order status distribution
   - `AssetsByCriticalityChart` - Placeholder for assets by criticality
   - `InventoryStatusChart` - Placeholder for inventory status

### Dashboard Features Now Working:
- ✅ Tabbed interface for different metrics views
- ✅ Work order trends chart
- ✅ Work orders by status pie chart
- ✅ Quick actions section
- ✅ Key metrics cards
- ✅ Recent activity feed
- ✅ Mobile responsive layout
